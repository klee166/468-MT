### Chosing a translation model

Currently, we're considering two approaches: Compositional Distribution Models and Neural Machine Translation Models.

##### Compositional Distribution Models

Distributional semantic modelling hypothesizes that the meaning of a word is related to context (Harris, 1968; Firth, 1957). The meaning of words are represented as vectors based on distribution of co-occuring terms within a context. This ties semantic similarity to vector similarity, and linear algebra can used to solve for problems.

What CDM does is that it ties DSM to formal semantic rules, or traditional SMT models.
