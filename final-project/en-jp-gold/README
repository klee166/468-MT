======= Instructions =======
The dataset is structured as follows:
README - this file
COPYING - Copyright for this dataset
annotations.json - alignment information with the following: (1) is there parallel data (2) what language pair is the parallel data if any (3) which are the spans of the parallel data
bitext/<lang-pair> - folder with parallel data extracted from the annotations 

Keep in mind that this gold standard is created by annotating tweets from Sina Weibo. So, if you are using this as gold standard to evaluate your translation system and the our parallel dataset to train (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lingwang/microtopia/data/weibo/corpora_compressed/utopia.cn-en.tar.gz), make sure you clean for near duplicates in the training data.
