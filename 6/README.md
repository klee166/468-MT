## Inflection

**â€”Collaborated with [Sarah Watanabe](https://github.com/swatana3).**

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), translation from a morphologically poor language [like English] to a morphologically rich language [like Czech] is a complex task. Generally, this is accomplished in a two-fold form: (1) The source language word is stemmed to a lemma, and translated to a target language lemma (assume bijection), (2) the target language lemma is then morphologically corrected to give the proper target word (**target side morphology**: translation into lemma, inflection as post-processing).

Here, we implement an inflection generation model which given a Czech lemma generates inflected Czech word with the best accuracy.
