## Inflection

**â€”Collaborated with [Sarah Watanabe](https://github.com/swatana3).**

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), translation from a morphologically poor language [like English] to a morphologically rich language [like Czech] is a complex task. Generally, this is accomplished in a two-fold form: (1) The source language word is stemmed to a lemma, and translated to a target language lemma (assume bijection), (2) the target language lemma is then morphologically corrected to give the proper target word (**target side morphology**: translation into lemma, inflection as post-processing).

Here, we implement an inflection generation model which given a Czech lemma generates inflected Czech word with the best accuracy.

##### Data
We work with a parallel corpus of lemmas, morphological features (for our purposes, only POS tags), and inflected forms. All taken from [here](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T01).

##### Result
| Inflection Generation Method |  Accuracy  |
| --------------- |:---------:|
| Baseline (no inflection) | 0.33 |
| Most likely inflection (from counting) | 0.57 |
